### Sprint 3 User Stories to Demo
* Favorites - As a user that has preferred songs, I would like to be able to favorite songs so I can access them more easily in the future. 
* Group Queue - As a user that listens with friends often, my friends and I often want to play different songs without interrupting what is currently playing.
* Messaging - As a user with friends, I would like to be able to message my friends.
